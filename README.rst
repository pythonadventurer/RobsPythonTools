Rob's Python Tools
##################

A Rapidly Evolving Collection of Useful Things.

System Requirements
===================
These were developed with Python 3.8 on Windows 10.  I'm sure they could be made to work on Linux or Mac OS.


Python Libraries Required
=========================
See requirements.txt.  

To install: 
``pip install -r requirements.txt``


Examples of What's In Here
==========================
* Extract eBay Active Listings data from locally saved "Webpage Complete" to a CSV file.  Ultimate destination: a Microsoft Access inventory database.
* Convert downloaded PayPal transactions to a CSV file that can be easily imported into GnuCash, with correct accounts.
* A nice little Message Box feature, that can be used to pop up and inform the user that a task is complete.  Does not require use of Tkinter or any other GUI tool.
* Time Tools, a module packed with useful functions for working with dates and times. 

..and more.


Documentation
=============
See the docstrings and comments in the code.  

Obviously you'll need to change the paths in the configuration file ``config.ini`` to locations on your own PC.


License
=======
This code is released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.TXT for terms).  In other words, do what you want to with it, and have fun.
